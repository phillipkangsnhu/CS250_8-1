## How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

By conducting user interviews, surveys, and gathering metrics from software usage, I can determine what users want and create "user stories" to communicate this to the team. By creating user stories, I give context into why a user wants a certain feature, and I help the team understand the feature's prioritization.  

## How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

I approach developing programs by breaking it down into core components, then arranging by priority of what component is the most impactful and has the least time to develop. This is essentially building the backlog in agile terms. At a predetermined period (usually 2 weeks), I would want to do a retrospective to see if my priority estimations were correct in their impact. This is a good way to learn more about the space I'm developing programs for, and to course correct if any assumptions were incorrect.  

## What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

To be a good team member in software development is to be engaged, listen, and treat your team well. It is very much a group activity and works best when everybody is supporting each other.
